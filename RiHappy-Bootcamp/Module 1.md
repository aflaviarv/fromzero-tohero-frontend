# Ri Happy - Front-End from Scratch - Module 1

## Introduction to Front-End Development

## The Evolution of Computing

### First Generation
- **Harvard Mark I (1944)**: Electromechanical computer designed for cryptographic and military calculations.
- **Colossus (1946)**: Early programmable digital computer used for codebreaking during World War II.
- **ENIAC (1946)**: Overheating issues attracted insects, coining the term *bug* in computing.

### Second Generation
- Transition from vacuum tubes to transistors, leading to more compact and portable computers.

### Third Generation
- Introduction of integrated circuits, consisting of:
  - **Capacitors**
  - **Transistors**
  - **Resistors**

### Fourth Generation
- **Microprocessors**: Enabled the creation of personal computers (PCs).
- **Introduction of the Mouse**: Popularized by Apple.

### Fifth Generation
- Advancements in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Cryptocurrency**, and **Quantum Computing**.

## The Rise of the Internet

The internet evolved alongside computing advancements. 

- **Early Communication Systems**: Morse code and radio signals played a critical role, especially during the Cold War.
- **DARPA & ARPANET**: The **Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)** initiated research into large-scale network communication.
- **First Internet Connection (October 29, 1969)**: The first message transmitted was *LOGIN*.
- **Development of TCP/IP (by Vinton Cerf & Robert Kahn)**: Standardized internet communication protocols.

## The World Wide Web

Before the 1990s, internet access was limited to military and academic institutions.
- **Tim Berners-Lee (1989)**: Created the **World Wide Web (WWW)**, combining TCP/IP with hypertext (early HTML), which led to the first web browser.

## Key Historical Figures in Computing

### Grace Murray Hopper
- A pioneering programmer involved in the development of the Mark I.
- Created **Flow-Matic**, a high-level programming language that influenced **COBOL**.
- Popularized the term *bug* in computing.

### Joseph Licklider
- Proposed the concept of a "galactic network" of interconnected computers.
- Advocated for **computer-mediated communication**, laying the foundation for modern networking.

### Robert E. Kahn
- Co-creator of **TCP/IP**, the backbone of internet communication.
- First public demonstrator of **email** technology.

### Tim Berners-Lee
- Known as the **father of the internet**, he developed the **WWW**.
- Knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his contributions to technology.

### Marc Andreessen
- Developed **Netscape Navigator**, an early graphical web browser based on **Mosaic**.
- Revolutionized web browsing, making the internet more accessible.

### Bill Gates
- Co-founder of **Microsoft**, instrumental in integrating **Internet Explorer** into Windows, accelerating internet adoption.

### Steve Jobs
- Co-founder of **Apple**, pivotal in the development of:
  - The **first computer mouse**.
  - The **iPhone (2007)**, revolutionizing mobile computing.
