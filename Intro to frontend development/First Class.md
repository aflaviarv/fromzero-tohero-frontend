## History of the Web

### First Generation
- **1944 - Harvard Mark I**: Electromechanical computer based on vacuum tubes, designed for cryptography and war calculations.
- **1946 - Colossus**: Built for codebreaking during World War II.
- **1946 - ENIAC**: The term "bug" was coined due to machine overheating attracting insects that caused failures.

### Second Generation
- Transition from vacuum tubes to **transistors**.
- Computers became more portable (able to be moved from room to room).

### Third Generation
- **Integrated circuits** were developed:
  - Capacitors
  - Transistors
  - Resistors

### Fourth Generation
- **Microprocessors** revolutionized computing.
- Introduction of **Personal Computers (PCs)**.
- **Mouse** developed by Apple.

### Fifth Generation
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.
- **Cryptocurrency**.
- **Quantum Computers**.

## The Rise of the Internet
The internet evolved alongside computer advancements.

- One of the earliest communication systems was **Morse code**.
- The **Cold War** fueled technological innovation, including the **space race**.
- The **Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)** initiated large-scale communication networks.
- **Joseph Licklider** introduced the idea of interconnected computer networks.
- **Packet-switched networks** emerged, laying the groundwork for modern networking.

### ARPANET: The First Internet Connection
- On **October 29, 1969**, ARPANET made history by transmitting the first-ever message: **"Login"**.
- **Vinton Cerf & Robert Kahn** later developed **TCP/IP**, the foundational internet protocol.

### The Web Revolution
Initially, internet technology was restricted to governments and large corporations. There was no popular means of accessing information.

- In **1989**, **Tim Berners-Lee** combined **TCP/IP** with **hypertext** (early HTML) to create the **World Wide Web (WWW)**.
- This led to the development of the first web browser.

## Key Figures in Web History

### **Grace Murray Hopper**
- One of the first programmers in history.
- Helped develop the **Mark I** computer.
- Created the **Flow-Matic** programming language, which later influenced **COBOL**.
- Fun fact: Popularized the term **"bug"**.

### **Joseph Licklider**
- Proposed a **"Galactic Network"** of computers.
- Key figure in the development of early networking concepts.

### **Robert E. Kahn**
- Co-creator of **TCP/IP** for ARPANET.
- First to publicly present **email**.

### **Tim Berners-Lee**
- Known as the **father of the web**.
- Invented **WWW**, enabling widespread internet access.
- Fun fact: Knighted by **Queen Elizabeth II**.

### **Marc Andreessen**
- Created the **Netscape Navigator**, an evolution of the **Mosaic** browser.
- Introduced graphical enhancements that dominated 90% of internet usage at the time.

### **Bill Gates**
- **Founder of Microsoft**.
- Microsoft developed **Internet Explorer**, bundling it with Windows computers.

### **Steve Jobs**
- **Founder of Apple**.
- Pioneered the development of the **mouse**.
- Played a major role in the **smartphone revolution** in 2007.
